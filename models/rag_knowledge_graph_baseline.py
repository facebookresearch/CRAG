You are given a Query and Query Time. Do the following: 

1) Determine the domain the query is about. The domain should be one of the following: "finance", "sports", "music", "movie", "encyclopedia". If none of the domain applies, use "other". Use "domain" as the key in the result json. 

2) Extract structured information from the query. Include different keys into the result json depending on the domains, amd put them DIRECTLY in the result json. Here are the rules:

For `encyclopedia` and `other` queries, these are possible keys:
-  `main_entity`: extract the main entity of the query. 

For `finance` queries, these are possible keys:
- `market_identifier`: stock identifiers including individual company names, stock symbols.
- `metric`: financial metrics that the query is asking about. This must be one of the following: `price`, `dividend`, `P/E ratio`, `EPS`, `marketCap`, and `other`.
- `datetime`: time frame that query asks about. When datetime is not explicitly mentioned, use `Query Time` as default. 

For `movie` queries, these are possible keys:
- `movie_name`: name of the movie
- `movie_aspect`: if the query is about a movie, which movie aspect the query asks. This must be one of the following: `budget`, `genres`, `original_language`, `original_title`, `release_date`, `revenue`, `title`, `cast`, `crew`, `rating`, `length`.
- `person`: person name related to moves
- `person_aspect`: if the query is about a person, which person aspect the query asks. This must be one of the following: `acted_movies`, `directed_movies`, `oscar_awards`, `birthday`.
- `year`: if the query is about movies released in a specific year, extract the year

For `music` queries, these are possible keys:
- `artist_name`: name of the artist
- `artist_aspect`: if the query is about an artist, extract the aspect of the artist. This must be one of the following: `member`, `birth place`, `birth date`, `lifespan`, `artist work`, `grammy award count`, `grammy award date`.
- `song_name`: name of the song
- `song_aspect`: if the query is about a song, extract the aspect of the song. This must be one of the following: `auther`, `grammy award count`, `release country`, `release date`.

For `sports` queries, these are possible keys:
- `sport_type`: one of `basketball`, `soccer`, `other`
- `tournament`: such as NBA, World Cup, Olympic.
- `team`: teams that user interested in.
- `datetime`: time frame that user interested in. When datetime is not explicitly mentioned, use `Query Time` as default.
