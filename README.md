# CRAG: Comprehensive RAG Benchmark

The Comprehensive RAG Benchmark (CRAG) is a rich and comprehensive factual question answering benchmark designed to advance research in RAG. Besides question-answer pairs, CRAG provides mock APIs to simulate web and knowledge graph search. CRAG is designed to encapsulate a diverse array of questions across five domains and eight question categories, reflecting varied entity popularity from popular to long-tail, and temporal dynamisms ranging from years to seconds.

## 📊 Dataset and Mock APIs

Please find more details about the CRAG dataset (download, schema, etc.) in [docs/dataset.md](docs/dataset.md) and mock APIs in [mock_api](mock_api).


## 📏 Evaluation Metrics
RAG systems are evaluated using a scoring method that measures response quality to questions in the evaluation set. Responses are rated as perfect, acceptable, missing, or incorrect:

- Perfect: The response correctly answers the user question and contains no hallucinated content.

- Acceptable: The response provides a useful answer to the user question, but may contain minor errors that do not harm the usefulness of the answer.

- Missing: The answer does not provide the requested information. Such as “I don’t know”, “I’m sorry I can’t find …” or similar sentences without providing a concrete answer to the question.

- Incorrect: The response provides wrong or irrelevant information to answer the user question


Auto-evaluation: 
- Automatic evaluation employs rule-based matching and LLM assessment to check answer correctness. It will assign three scores: correct (1 point), missing (0 points), and incorrect (-1 point).


Please refer to [local_evaluation.py](local_evaluation.py) for more details on how the evaluation was implemented.

## ✍️ How to run end-to-end evaluation?
1. **Install** specific dependencies
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

2. Please follow the instructions in [models/README.md](models/README.md) for instructions and examples on how to write your own models.

3. After writing your own model(s), update [models/user_config.py](models/user_config.py)

   For example, in models/user_config.py, specify InstructModel to call llama3-8b-instruct model
   ```bash
   from models.vanilla_llama_baseline import InstructModel 
   UserModel = InstructModel

   ```

4. Test your model locally using `python local_evaluation.py`. This script will run answer generation and auto-evaluation.


## 🏁 Baselines
We include three baselines for demonstration purposes, and you can read more about them in [docs/baselines.md](docs/baselines.md).
