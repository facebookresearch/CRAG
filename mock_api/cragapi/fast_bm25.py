        ----------
        corpus : list of list of str
                Given corpus.
        k1 : float
                Constant used for influencing the term frequency saturation. After saturation is reached, additional
                presence for the term adds a significantly less additional score. According to [1]_, experiments suggest
                that 1.2 < k1 < 2 yields reasonably good results, although the optimal value depends on factors such as
                the type of documents or queries.
        b : float
                Constant used for influencing the effects of different document lengths relative to average document length.
                When b is bigger, lengthier documents (compared to average) have more impact on its effect. According to
                [1]_, experiments suggest that 0.5 < b < 0.8 yields reasonably good results, although the optimal value
                depends on factors such as the type of documents or queries.
        alpha: float
                IDF cutoff, terms with a lower idf score than alpha will be dropped. A higher alpha will lower the accuracy
                of BM25 but increase performance
